# Advent of Code

Started in Lua but switched to Go (because Lua's string handling is a little, well, basic, and native Lua 5.1 does not have the bitwise stuff). Sometimes, Go's standard library feels a bit like cheating.

The aim is to - eventually - do all puzzles from all years. Much of the code is quick-and-dirty and I'm often surprised to get the right answer. Occasionally I ask GPT-4 for help with a function; I've given up on Google's Bard, which has yet to yield any correct answers.
